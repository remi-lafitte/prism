#+TITLE: The effect of prism adaptation on verticality perception
#+AUTHOR: RJL

* Introduction 
1. Prism adaptation : visuo motor alteration that induces compensation
   and adaptation
2. effect of PA on spatial cognition, notably in usn,  on other modalities
3. effect of PA on the personal space perception, such as haptic
   exploration, or tactile perception, or arm sense position
4. PA act on the inter-hemispheric competition, by inhibiting the
   contralateral (to the optical shift) hemipshere. Explain the
   recents models.
5. PA can improve postural stability. No effect have been found on
   gravity perception, but very few studies run until now.
6. Yet, many studies found a systematic link between usn and
   vertical misperception.
7. In the horizontal dimension, usn can be linked with attentional and
   representational disorder to the lack of (multi)sensory integration
   (jacobs, 12). This lack of sensory integration could be also
   explained the vertical bias.
8. Indeed, there is two hypothsesis : either cortical otolithic
   imbalance, or somatosensory imbalance. Txhese two solutions fits
   well with the association between usn and lateropulsion for ex.
9. Thus, there is maybe a causal link between space perception in the
   horizontal and vertical perception.
10. Because PA act on the horizontal perception on the patho and
    healthy subject, PA could act on verticality perception in the
    healthy subject.
11. We can speculate that if inter-hemispheric competition act on both
    the egocentric and gravity referentials, then PA might affect both referentials.

* Methods

- How many participants ?
- Prism adaptation = which degree ? number of pointing, description of
  the apparatus
- The task =
  - horiz tasks = SSA, OLP, LM. Note that we must use a passive
    proprioceptive task, or a visual SA task. Badly, impossible to
    touch the subject ... Thus maybe more simple to assess
    after-effect with an egocentric task ? or maybe not because we are
    not interested in this effect...The SSA will be sufficient.
  - vert tasks = VV, LBA, SSA in the supine position ?
  - Thus we can have a total of three tasks. The VV task and LBA are
    not very long because there is only 10 trials. the LM task must be
    stimulating, with a lot of pre-tests !! Maybe recolting data
    online can be useful. We can modifiate the script of E. ... or run
    the expe with a simple program like sesame in a first time...
  - Quid of a psychometric version of the VV task ?? Hard to compute I
    think, but in theory more reliable to detect very fine-grain
    effects ... 
- The procedure = First the participants will perform the LM and VV
  task, randomly. Then, they will execute 250 pointing, with an
  optical shift of 15°. the after-effects will be evaluated
  immediately after the prism removal with OLP and the SSA task. Then
  the participant will perform the VV task, and then the LM task. The
  VV will be performed always before the LM task, to avoid a
  re-adaptation effect during the LM task. If the LBA is performed, it
  will be performed either before or after the VV task. Or maybe
  always after, because the supine position can decrease arousal.
- The variables will be = group (d, g, c) * session (pre, post)
- The statistical design is a mixed anova. There is multiple
  possibilities :
  - 1) perform a mixed model analysis with the following design = VD ~
    session*group + (1+session|S) + (1 | items). items can be useful
    to control the variance due to the initial offset orientation.
  - 2) perform a simple mixed anova. the interaction must be
    decomposed with post-hoc comparisons. Nevertheless it is not
    necessary the case if we planned linear and quadratic
    contrasts. (polynomial analysis)
  - 3) if we have a full within-subject design, we ll have more power
    ! We ll get this design = VD ~ 1 + group*session + (1 +
    group:session | S).
    
- What if the anova conditions are not respected because of outliers
  or normality ? It will be possible to perform no parametric tests on
 delta score...with contrast ...
- Outliers must be detect in pre-test ? we can exclude subject with a
  mean verticality outside 3° to be not too much conservative.
- If we opt for a within design, maybe pre test is useless ? right if
  we have a sham prism condition. But is may be too heavy.
- The data will be collected by computer and entered in R.
